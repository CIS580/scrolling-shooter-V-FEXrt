    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Captain we must find the envading force of aliens. Their technology is very similar to ours to keep a look out for the damage their weapons do based on your own weapons.
    Collect the orange and green gems to power up your weapons, but avoid the black gems as they will downgrade your weapons.
